title: about d/place
---

d/place started as a small project called discord/place by [Skoopy](skoopy.jased.xyz), an experiment of sorts to see what would happen if users were given full control over a discord server. The name was inspired by "r/place", which had a similar concept. [discord/place](https://discord.gg/DcQH4hYHwE)(nowadays called "d/place legacy") was the stuff of pure anarchy. Factions came and went, many exciting events happened, and none of it was recorded(hence why it is not recorded in the [Archives](dplace-world.github.io/history)). 

It was eventually closed once the chaos was over, and the admin perms were removed, and [Skoopy](skoopy.jased.xyz), as well as [Jased](jased.xyz), made a brand new server called "d/place". [Skoopy](skoopy.jased.xyz) started to record everything that happened on the server with notepad, and both [Skoopy](skoopy.jased.xyz), and [Jased](jased.xyz) started to develop the d/place bot(that was unfortunately never really used since it was never online) and the [d/place website](dplace-world.github.io), you know, the one you're on right now!

Near the end of Season 1, [Jased](jased.xyz) decided to purge the whole server, as the server became inactive and needed a fresh start. This was the beginning of Season 2.

After a whirlwind of events that was Season 2, [Skoopy](skoopy.jased.xyz) and [Jased](jased.xyz) decided to start Season 3. However, the server lost excitement and was mostly dead, o [Skoopy](skoopy.jased.xyz) chose to shut down d/place for good and it became dead/place.
